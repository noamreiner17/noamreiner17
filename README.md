## Hi there welcome to my git!👋

I’m a computer science and math major at Brandeis, I'm passionate about coding and learning! Feel free to explore my public projects, and if you're interested in learning more about my private repositories, feel free to connect on LinkedIn and I'd love to share more. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me:

- 👩🏽‍🍳 Cooking and baking!
- 🧩 Solving logical puzzles (aka sodukos and nonograms)
- 🗺️ Traveling and exploring!
